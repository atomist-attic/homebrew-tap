# DEPRECATED - Atomist Homebrew Tap

Good news, the [Atomist CLI][cli] formula is now available in the
[Homebrew][brew] core tap!  You can install as you would any core
Homebrew formula:

```
$ brew install atomist-cli
```

[cli]: https://github.com/atomist/cli (Atomist - CLI)
[brew]: https://brew.sh/ (Homebrew - The missing package manager for macOS)

You can "untap" this custom tap, it is no longer needed:

```
$ brew untap atomist/tap
```

## Deprecated tap instructions

```
$ brew tap atomist/tap
$ brew install atomist-cli
```
